# <Code Refactor>
 
## Description
This project is simply updating codes and making it work the same. I did this to ensure that I understand the contcept of modern syntax, but also making sure to minimize codes and making them shorter. 
 
- What was your motivation?
 I need to get beter at coding and it is important to understand how to make a clean code.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 I built this project because it is neccessary to learn ways code refactoring works when it comes down to reducing the amount of codes you have and also inputting modern day code.
- What problem does it solve?
This solves the problem of way too many lines in code when you do not need it. It also teaches the different ways to divided the elements of code like <div> and <section> and <aside>.
- What did you learn?
 I learned how to condense code and make it into one if there is repetitive elements or elements that can be put into one. I learned how to use different elements like <section>, <div>, <aside> understand what is happening or simply use them as an acknowledgment of what is happening in the code there.
